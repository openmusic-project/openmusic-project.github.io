OpenMusic (OM) is a visual programming language designed for music
composition. Visual programs (called "patches") can be created by connecting
graphical modules together, corresponding to musical objects or data
processing functions.

OM offers you a complete freedom in programming, including text programming
via the Common Lisp language. A large numbers of specialized projects and
libraries are available for specific applications (mathematical tools, sound
processing and synthesis, etc.)

This documentation is divided in two main parts :

  *  **A complete user manual** describing the use and features of the evironment
  *  **A "quickstart" tutorial** with video demonstrations

OM Libraries

Note that many tools available in OpenMusic are part of separate libraries,
which are not documented in this manual.
