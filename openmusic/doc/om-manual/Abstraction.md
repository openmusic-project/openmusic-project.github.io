# Abstraction

Abstraction

A program or patch can be more or less complex, and comprise one or several
components "layers", like a tree structure. Such structures consist of patches
embedded into other patches. Processes embedded in higher-level programs are
called ** abstractions**.

Abstraction aims at using a program as a  **function** within another program.

  * From a formal view, an abstraction results from the  **conversion of one or several elements of a program into variables** . 
  * Consequently, in practical terms, an abstraction must have at least one outlet to ** communicate with the external environment **. 

Purposes

Abstractions allow to :

  * define and visualize the structure of a complex program,

  * bring modularity in a program,

  * control the development of a compositional architecture and processes, or considering it from another prospect,

  * gain space in a patch editor...

Example : Abstraction of a Process

Abstraction is a very convenient procedure - an abstracted program can be
complex and "bulky". Its representation as an object also shows what an
abstraction actually is : a coherent and delineated function inside another
program. This is the crucial, essential property of functional abstraction.
