# Rhythm Trees

Rhythmic objects - and polyphonic objects - integrate a rhythmic parameter,
which can be programmed by the user via  **rhythm trees** .

A rhythm tree is a  **list** representing a rhythmic structure. This list is
organized hierarchically in  **sub lists** , just as time is organized in
measures, time signatures, pulses and rhythmic elements in the traditional
notation.

Hence, the expression form of rhythm trees is crucially different from that of
onsets and offsets. It can be exacting and not very "ergonomic", from a
musician's point of view : rhythm trees can be long, with a great number of
parenthesis and sub lists nested within each others.

This section provides the syntactic and semantic principles that rule rhythm
trees. We also advise the user to follow the rhythm trees tutorial provided
with the OM application.
