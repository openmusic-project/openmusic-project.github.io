# Resources

Resources are images or icons dedicated to the visual interface of OM. The
user may have to choose images or icons for various reasons : inserting an
image in a patch, giving an identity to a temporal object[1] in a maquette,
choosing an icon for a patch, a class or a function...

## Generalities

The user may be asked to select pictures or icons in several cases. In this
case, a **Resource Selection** dialog will appear and help selecting the
corresponding file from OM or user resources (see section below).

Format, Size and Name

Several formats can be handled by the OM interface :

  * **TIF** files (.tif, .tiff), 
  * **JPEG** files (.jpg, .jpeg), 
  * **GIF** files (.gif), 
  * **BMP** files (.bmp) 
  * **PNG** files (.png). 

Pictures and icons can have background transparency alpha layer.

Icons shouldn't exceed 64 pixels and be given a numeric reference such as
"127.tiff".

Images can have any name and dimensions.

Uses

Pictures or icons can be assigned as background pictures in patches and
maquettes. They can also be assigned to the patches and maquettes or other
user-defined items in the Workspace and Library windows.
