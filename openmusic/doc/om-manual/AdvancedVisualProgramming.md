# Visual Programming II (Advanced)

This section describes the following advanced programming concepts and tools :

  * defining options or control procedures within programs,

  * designing complex programming structures by the means of functional abstraction[1] or iteration[2],

  * manipulating and globalizing objects with instances[3] and global variables[4],

  * using files and advanced user inetraction modules.

References :

  1. Functional Abstraction

A functional abstraction is a program whose some elements can become
variables, via connections to the outside environment. Hence, this program
must have inputs or outputs that can be connected to external variable
elements. The resulting functional abstraction can then be embedded into other
programs to be used as a functional component.

  2. Iteration

The repetition of a process within a computer program.

See also : Recursion.

  3. Instance

An actual object created at runtime, out of a given class. In OM, more
specifically, an object created when evaluating a factory box. An instance can
be saved as a global variable.

⤷ `SHIFT` click on an outlet - especially the first outlet representing the
self, the whole object - of a factory box to materialize an instance.

  4. Global variable

An instance of OM object that has been saved in order to be used in other
programs. Global variables are visible from the `Library` window and stored as
.omi files in the `Globals` folder of the workspace.
