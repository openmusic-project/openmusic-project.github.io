# OpenMusic QuickStart

This quickstart aims at providing fundamental notions and guidelines to start 
using OM and design a simple program. All steps, from launching to quitting
the application, are thoroughly presented in video clips.

Each section includes links to the OM User Manual as well as keyword
definitions. These can constitute conceptual and practical entry points
towards the main documentation, for those who have little or no experience
with OpenMusic.

From this basis, little by little, the user can develop his or her own
expertise and techniques, with the help of other documentation volumes and
tutorials, which complete this handover of the application.
