## Slots

name| data type(s)| comments  
---|---|---  
` _self_`| [ **Sound**](sound) object|  
  
## Notes

[ **Sound**](sound) factories are generally obtained by dragging an AIFF
file from the finder to a patch window. After doing that, lock the icon
immediately or you will lose its contents when you try to evaluate it.

An unlocked [**Sound**](sound) object when evaluated will bring up a
dialog box asking you to find an AIFF file.
