# Chapter 1. Using the Class Reference

Below are entries describing the score classes in OM. This reference will be
expanded in future versions to include all the other classes in the Classes
menu.

The class reference presents the standard lisp syntax of the class for the
technically inclined, as well as a breakdown of the slots of the class the
function, one by one, and the data types they accept. See the chapters [Data
Types](concepts.data-types) and [Classes](concepts.classes). For
more information.

A sample reference page follows.
