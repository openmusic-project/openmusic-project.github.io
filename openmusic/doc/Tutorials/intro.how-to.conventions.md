# Notation Conventions

As in all computer manuals, we've adopted certain notation conventions
throughout the documentaton for clarity. The following typographical rules
apply:

When we talk about keys on the computer keyboard, they are represented **like
this**.

Examples: **a** , **r** , space

Combinations of keystrokes are sometimes required, meaning that one key is
held while another is pressed or while the mouse is clicked:

Examples: option- **i** , command- **a** , option- **->**.

The possible keys to hold down are ctrl, option, and command (also known as
the apple key). The one exception is shift with letter keys, where I've chosed
simply to indicate the uppercase letter. The cursor movement keys are
represented by the arrows <- -> ↓ ↑.

When talking about selecing items from the pulldown menus, they are indicated
in the order you must select them from the top level. For example, selecting
the item "New Patch" from the "New" submenu in the "File" pull-down menu at
the top of the screen is represented: File->New->New Patch.

Example: Functions->music->score->OMQUANTIFY

Names of functions are never capitalized and are always printed `like this`.
Names of classes are always capitalized and printed **like this**. Data types
are not normally capitalized (except when a class is a data type) and are
printed like this.

Examples: [`first`](first), **Poly** , t, **Note** , [`list`](list),
integer.

All set? Then let's go!
