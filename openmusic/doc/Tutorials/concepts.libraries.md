# Chapter 12. Libraries

A library is a specialized set of class and method definitions written
directly in [_LISP_](glossary#LISP) (as opposed to a class or method that
you create with OM's graphic interface).

Libraries add extra functionality to OM. Many libraries are included with OM
on the CD-ROM, and should have been automatically installed simultaneously
with it. They are stored in the  UserLibrary  folderm within the OM folder
itself.

You can browse the available libraries in the packages window in the special
libraries subpackage (the yellow suitcases). In order to use the library, you
must first load it by double-clicking the lower half of the suitcase icon,
after which the suitcase opens and you can view the contents. The functions
and classes of the suitcases will also become available in the Functions and
Classes menu bar when in the patch window.
