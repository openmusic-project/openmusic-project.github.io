# Chapter 16. Introduction

 |

Some of these examples were part of the first OpenMusic tutorial written by
the composer Jaccobo Baboni that we would like to thanks for letting us use
them, as we found them very instructive and enriching. Other examples were
made by ourselves.

At last but not least, we would like to thank a lot all the RepMus team Gerard
Assayag and Carlos Augusto Agon, creators and conceptors of OpenMusic for
their precious help, invaluable support and encouragement. Special thanks also
to the composer Markus Buser who had the patience and the kindness in proof
reading our tutorial.

The original OM tutorials were written by Karim Haddad, with patches by Jacobo
Baboni, Mikhail Malt, and Karim Haddad. I've edited them for clarity and
regrouped them by theme and complexity, which should be more approachable for
the new user.

You can use the Last Saved function in the menu File->Last Saved in the patch
view to restore the patch to its original condition, provided you've not saved
it yourself. This is useful since OM has no Undo function.
