# Chapter 1. Macintosh Common Lisp

OpenMusic is an interactive graphic environment for composition and MIDI
processing. It is a spiritual descendant of the Patchwork software some of you
may be familiar with. However, OpenMusic implements a set of radically new
features that make it a second generation compositional tool. OpenMusic, or
OM, is written in, and runs on top of, Digitool [_Macintosh Common
Lisp_](glossary#MCL). It provides a visual programming interface for Lisp
programming as well as to CLOS (Common Lisp Object System).
