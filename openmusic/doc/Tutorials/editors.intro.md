# VI. OM Editors Reference

# The Graphic Editors

In OM certain kinds of factory icons are associated with graphic editors which
are called up by double-clicking the icon in the patch window. This is
particularly useful for editing musical data, since it is easire to manipulate
music notation than lines of code or series of numbers. OM provides music
notation editing capabilities as well as other kinds of graphic editors for
other types of data.

Graphic editors generally consist of two windows: a Data Window, where data is
presented, and a General Palette window, which contains tools used to
manipulate the data in the Data Window. Some graphic editors only present a
Data Window.

The General Palette window is "folding" in some cases; clicking the black
triangle button in the upper right corner reveals or conceals additional
buttons.

Note that both the Patch and Maquette windows are themselves graphic editors.
Keyboard and mouse commands as well as any toolbar buttons are summarized
here. For a more complete conceptual description of these windows, refer to
the Chapters on Patches and Maquettes in the main section of the manual.
