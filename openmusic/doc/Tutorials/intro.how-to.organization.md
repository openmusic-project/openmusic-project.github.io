# Organization of the Manual

This manual is divided into four main parts:

  1. Getting Started - how to install and launch the software, and a quick tour intended to demonstrate the basic notions of the software.

  2. The OpenMusic Concepts - The meat of the Manual, being a systematic description of the elements of the OM environment. I've put them in what seems the most logical order, but there is not necessarily any continuity between the sections. These chapters are comprehensive but not progressive.

  3. The Tutorials - the counterpart to the Concepts. Here, a series of tasks are presented, in increasing order of complexity. Unlike the Concepts section, only what is directly relevant to the task at hand is discussed. These chapters are progressive but not comprehensive.

  4. Reference - a series of indexes. All the [_functions_](glossary#FUNCTION) and [_classes_](glossary#CLASS) are documented on their own pages. There follows a glossary and an index.

## What is assumed

As mentioned before, we've assumed a lot of motivation but little expertise on
the part of the reader. We do assume you know how files and folders are
heirarchically organized on your computer, and how to open, close, and move
them around. If this describes you, but only just, you probably should start
at the beginning of the Getting Started section, install OM, set it up, then
take Quick Tour from start to finish. Then, start the first of the General
Tutorials. Work your way through the tutorials, refering to the Reference and
the Concepts as you feel necessary.

Users very comfortable with computers but unfamiliar with object-oriented
programming should should take the Quick Tour and then go to the General
Tutorials, skimming or skipping the first few until things start looking
interesting.

Users with a bit of OM experience will be primary interested in the newly
rewritten Concepts section and the all-new entries on the [graphic
editors](editors.intro) in the Reference section.
