The main interface to OpenMusic is the Workspace window. The Workspace is a
icon-oriented browser which behaves in much the same way as the Macintosh
Finder. Icons represent OpenMusic objects or folders where objects (or
subfolders) may be stored.

Objects the Workspace are persistent. This means they hang around until you
delete them, which is done with the Clear command. OM performs a general save
of the Workspace and all objects in it at the end of each session.
Nonetheless, you may force a save of any part of the Workspace by using the
Save command. If you are in a patch, only that patch is saved. If you are in
the Workspace, you may either select an object and save it, or click in the
background so that no object is selected and then save, which saves the entire
Workspace. This is useful since there is no undo function in OM. It will also
save you a good deal of stress in the event of a crash.
