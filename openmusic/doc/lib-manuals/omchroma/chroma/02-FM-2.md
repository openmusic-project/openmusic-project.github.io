Class description

The FM-1 Class realizes a simple Frequency Modulation Synthesis with the
following controls:

  * The main amplitude,
  * The frequency of the carrier,
  * The frequency of the modulator,
  * The amplitude envelope by means of a GEN routine,
  * The index envelope by means of a GEN routine,
  * The range between (imax & imin) of the index envelope.

FM-2 versus FM-1

There are few little differences between the [FM-1](01-FM-1) and FM-2
classes.

FM-1

|

FM-2  
  
---|---  
  
The Carrier is the generating frequency (f0) multiplied by the factor n1.

|

The Carrier is directly given.  
  
The Modulator is the generating frequency (f0) multiplied by the factor n2.

|

The Modulator is directly given.  
  
The amplitude and index envelope are initialized by a GEN05.

|

The amplitude and index envelope are initialized by a GEN07.

 **The slot f0 is not in service.**  
  
Patch description

These examples give the same results as the [Tutorial FM-1](01-FM-1)
entering the data in a different way.

The example A & B show the meaning of the FM index: the number of the
components of the side-band frequencies increase with the rising of the index.

The example C focuses on the carrier frequency with a steady sideband width
(10 Hz). The sound begins rough and ends with a nice vibrato for the sake of
the ratio between the modulating and the carrier frequency. At the beginning
the sidebands are 10% away from the carrier (10/100 = 0.1). At the end they
are 0.625% away (10/1600).

The example D focuses on the ratio between the modulating and the carrier
frequency.

  * M/C > 0.1 -> vibrato,
  * M/C = integer or 1/2^n -> harmonic spectra,
  * M/C = floating -> inharmonic spectra.

Reminder

If imax>imin the [BPF](http://support-old.ircam.fr/forum-ol-
doc/om/om6-manual/co/BPF-BPC "http://support-old.ircam.fr/forum-ol-
doc/om/om6-manual/co/BPF-BPC \(nouvelle fenêtre\)") given as envelope is
read forwards as usual (example A) but if imax<imin the BPF is read backwards
(example B).

Try to evaluate the object with both envelopes each with a different synt.
