Class description

The Stereo-2 Class allows to place the audio source in a stereo output with
the following controls :

  * The independent amplitude of both channels,
  * The duration of the single event,
  * The entry delay of each event.

Patch description

The example A shows how to place a mono sound file in a stereo panorama with
independent amplitude controls.

The example B shows how to use the generic function Chroma-Prisma to place a
mono sound file in a stereo panorama with independent amplitude controls.

Stereo-1 versus Stereo-2

Stereo-1 is a pan-pot, i.e. there is only one control and the two channels are
NOT independent, instead Stereo-2 has two independent control of both
channels.
