# OpenMusic Libraries

OpenMusic libraries contain extra tools dedicated to specific purposes.

A default folder for dynamically loadable libraries is created by OM:

- In OM 6.12 or earlier: within the OM application directory (_OM 6.xx/libraries/_)
- In OM 6.13 or newer: in your home directory (_~/OM/Libraries/_)


You can also add extra libraries folder and register them in OM:

- Create a directory "Libraries" (or any other name) somewhere in your computer _(but **not** in the OM directory!)_.
- Put your own libraries in this folder
- Register this directory in the OM Preferences ("Libraries" tab, **external user lib directories**).
- If necessary, use the menu item "File/Refresh Libraries Package..." on the Library window in order to update the libraries list. 

**Note:** Libraries can also be loaded as "Remote User Libs" (see "Library" window, Menu "File").


>  See in the [Developer resources](https://openmusic-project.github.io/openmusic/dev/index) for instructions about how to write your own OM library.

## Catalog

Most OpenMusic libraries can be found and downloaded from [https://github.com/openmusic-project/](https://github.com/openmusic-project/).
